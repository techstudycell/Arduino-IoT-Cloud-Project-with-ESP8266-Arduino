# Arduino-IoT-Cloud-Project-with-ESP8266-Arduino
In this IoT project, I have shown how to make an IoT-based Smart Home with Arduino IoT Cloud &amp; Alexa using ESP8266 Arduino to control 4 home appliances with voice commands, IR remote, and manual switches. If the internet is unavailable, you can control the home appliances from IR remote &amp; manual switches. In the article, I have shown all the steps to make this smart home system.
